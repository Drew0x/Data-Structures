Merge sort divides an array into halves, sorts the two halves and then merges them into one sorted array. The algorithm for merge sort is usually stated recursively.
Known as the divide and conquer algorithm.

Recursive Merge Sort: In a merge sort you merge two sorted arrays that are actually halves of the original array. 
Merge Sort has the following recursive formulation:

Algorithm mergeSort(a, tempArray, first, last)
//Sorts the array entries a[first] through a[last] recursively
if (first < last)
{
  mid = approximate midpoint between first and last
  mergeSort(a, tempArray, first, mid)
  mergeSort(a, tempArray, mid + 1, last)
  Merge the sorted halves a[first..mid] and a[mid + 1...last] using the array tempArray
}

Notice that the algorithm ignores arrays of one or fewer entries.
The following pseudocode describes the merge step:

Algorithm merge(a, tempArray, first, mid, last)
//Merges the adjacent subarrays a[first..mid] and a[mid + 1..last]
beginhalf1 = first
endHalf1 = mid
beginHalf2 = mid + 1
endHalf2 = last
//While both subarrays are not empty compare an entry in one subarray with
//an entry in the other; then copy the smaller item into the temporary array
index = 0;
while ( (beginHalf1 <= endHalf1) and (beginHalf2 <= endHalf2) )
{
  if(a[beginHalf1] <= a[beginHalf2])
{
    tempArray[index] = a[beginHalf1]
    beginHalf1++
} else { 
    tempArray[index] = a[beginHalf2]
    beginHalf2++
}
index++
}
//Assertion: One subarray has been completely compied to tempArray.

Merge sort rearranges the entries in an array during its merge steps.
