The exception class of SquareRootException

is made to find the square root of a negative number.

Imagine a class whose method someMethod has a throws clause in its header. If we override someMethod in a subclass can we list additional checked exceptions in its throws clause? No, java will not let us and will get a syntax error if we do.




NOTE: An overriding method in a subclass cannot list exceptions in a throws clause that arent listed in a throws clause of the overridden method in the superclass unless they are derived from the exception classes lsited in the overridden method. However, an overriding method can list fewer exception in its throws clause or none at all.

NOTE:: Statements within a finally block execute regardless of whether an exception occurs, but they do not execute if either the try block or a catch block calls System.exit. If no exception takes place, the finally block executes after its corresponding try block completes its execution.(If the try block contains a return statement, the finally block executes before the return.) However, if an exception occurs and it is caught by one of the catch blocks, the finally block executes after that catch block executes.
