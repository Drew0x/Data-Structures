Avoid nested try catch blocks if possible:
try finally or try catch or try catch finally

If a method contains a throw statement to throw an exception add a throws clause to its header rather than catching the exception within the methods body.
In general throwing an exception and catching one should occur in separate methods

Do not confuse the keywords throw and throws
You use the Java reserved word throws in a methods header to declare the exceptions that the method might throw. The reserved word throw is used within the body of a method to actually throw an exception.
